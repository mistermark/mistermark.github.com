          <p>Back in the day when I was still studying Art &amp; Design I had to take the train from Tilburg to Boxtel every day back and forth. At that time they called this kind of train a &#39;<em>Stoptrein</em>&#39;. Literally translated to English as &#39;stop train&#39;. Of course this doesn&#39;t mean the train never moves, or always stops, but it would just stop at every single station it goes through. It&#39;s counterpart would be the &#39;<em>Intercity</em>&#39;, which would only stop at the bigger cities worthy of it stopping by. But I&#39;m not going to talk about the &#39;Intercity&#39;, but about the difference of the train &#39;<em>Stoptrein</em>&#39;. Now being called a &#39;<em>Sprinter</em>&#39;.</p>

<p>Our Dutch railway system, &quot;<a href="http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nederlandse_Spoorwegen">Nederlandse Spoorwegen</a>&quot; or &quot;NS&quot; in short, is always trying to make things better for their customers. That would be us, the passengers. For example by using more personal greetings in their automated announcements. Their announcements now have a robot-like voice saying: &quot;Dames en heren… Goedemorgen!&quot; (&quot;Ladies and gentlemen… Goodmorning!&quot;). It almost feels as if they try so hard to be cool that they miss the boat of coolness by a long shot. Similar story here with renaming of the &quot;Stoptrein&quot;.</p>

<p>Probably they thought it would sound better to call the &quot;Stoptrein&quot; a &quot;Sprinter&quot; too, because it would imply the train would move faster in short sprints. Someone might&#39;ve come up with this idea because everyone was complaining about the train always being late or delayed due to the fact that it <strong>stops</strong> everywhere. So they decided to call the train a &quot;Sprinter&quot; instead. Giving the customer the idea the train isn&#39;t actually slow, or always delayed, but instead looking at it from the bright side: The train is always taking short sprints!</p>

<p>That&#39;s just wonderful, isn&#39;t it? A train that&#39;s always taking sprints to the next station! It&#39;s almost like this train is always trying to be faster. Okay, they&#39;ve also changed the look and interior of the train itself, but besides that it&#39;s still pulling over at every single station it arrives at. One might even think the name &quot;<em>stoptrein</em>&quot; would give such a negative impact on people that they are even getting depressed because of it. Causing the percentage of train-person accidents to increase. In that case I&#39;d like to know the percentage of today of the train-person accidents occurring with the &quot;Sprinter&quot; of this time.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying here I don&#39;t like the name of this train, &quot;Sprinter&quot;, but I&#39;m just wondering where the name comes from and why they didn&#39;t stick with the name &quot;<em>stoptrein</em>&quot;. After all, the railways here are called &quot;Nederlandse Spoorwegen&quot; (&quot;Dutch Railways&quot;). Wouldn&#39;t it then make more sense to keep having a more Dutch-like name to it? Keep that language alive as long as we can, please!</p>

<p>Oh, and those robot-like announcements they have? I&#39;ll be getting back to that later. That deserves an article on its own together with all the other &quot;wannabe-cool&quot; messages around the trains.</p>
